# PLM-ALM-with-GitLab
Creates a simple PLM-ALM integration using GitLab as ALM. The goal is to provide an integration which will allow the project managers to capture a specific tag/release/version in a product structure, controlled with the CMII change management process. It leaves the developper the possibility to mainly work with GitLab which could be their preferred data management environment.
#### How it works
With this project, Aras has a few federated object which are querying Gitlab through its REST webservice interface.
